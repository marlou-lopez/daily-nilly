# Daily Nilly

Helps you develop a habit whether you like it or not by letting you do mundane quests everyday that lets you level up your profile.

This project was inspired by Geshin Impact's daily commission system and battlepass system. It forced me to play the game and do the daily quests everyday so I thought maybe that type of system will help in real life. But of course, it will ultimately depend on the person.

## Roadmap

- Quests system
  - Add, edit, delete quests
  - Categorization (Daily, Weekly, General Quests)

  - Preferably no stats involved, just experience points
  - Self-Reward when certain levels are reached (?)
- Achievement system
